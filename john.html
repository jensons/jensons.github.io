<a class="verse" id="1v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.
<a class="verse" id="1v2"></a>He was with God in the beginning.
<a class="verse" id="1v3"></a>All things were made through Him, and nothing that was made was made without Him.
<a class="verse" id="1v4"></a>Life was in Him, and Life was the light of men.
<a class="verse" id="1v5"></a>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v6"></a>There was a man sent by God, whose name was John.
<a class="verse" id="1v7"></a>He arrived as a witness to offer testimony about the Light, so that all would believe through him.
<a class="verse" id="1v8"></a>He was not the Light, but he was to offer testimony about the Light.
<a class="verse" id="1v9"></a>The true Light, which illuminates every man, was coming into this world.</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="1v10"></a>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not recognize him.</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="1v11"></a>He went to his own, and his own did not accept him.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v12"></a>Yet whoever did accept him, those who believed in his name, he gave them the power to become the sons of God.
<a class="verse" id="1v13"></a>These are born, not of blood, nor of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="1v14"></a>And the Word became flesh, and he lived among us, and we saw his glory, glory like that of an only-begotten Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v15"></a>John offers testimony about him, and he cries out, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;This is the one about whom I said: &lsquo;He who is to come after me, has been placed ahead of me, because he existed before me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v16"></a>And from his fullness, we all have received, even grace for grace.
<a class="verse" id="1v17"></a>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through <span class="gold cross">Jesus Christ</span>.
<a class="verse" id="1v18"></a>No one ever saw God; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he himself has described him.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v19"></a>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him, so that they might ask him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v20"></a>And he confessed it and did not deny it; and what he confessed was: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v21"></a>And they questioned him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Then what are you? Are you Elijah?&rdquo;</span> And he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</span> <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo;</span> And he answered, <span class="quote">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v22"></a>Therefore, they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v23"></a>He said, </p>
<p class="normal hang centerleft"><span class="quote">&ldquo;I am a voice crying out in the desert, <br/>&lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord,&rsquo; 
<br/>just as the prophet Isaiah said.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v24"></a>And some of those who had been sent were from among the Pharisees.
<a class="verse" id="1v25"></a>And they questioned him and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, and not Elijah, and not the Prophet?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v26"></a>John answered them by saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I baptize with water. But in your midst stands one, whom you do not know.
<a class="verse" id="1v27"></a>The same is he who is to come after me, who has been placed ahead of me, the laces of whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v28"></a>These things happened in Bethania, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v29"></a>On the next day, John saw <span class="gold">Jesus</span> coming toward him, and so he said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God. Behold, he who takes away the sin of the world.
<a class="verse" id="1v30"></a>This is the one about whom I said, &lsquo;After me arrives a man, who has been placed ahead of me, because he existed before me.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="1v31"></a>And I did not know him. Yet it is for this reason that I come baptizing with water: so that he may be made manifest in Israel.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v32"></a>And John offered testimony, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;For I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove; and he remained upon him.
<a class="verse" id="1v33"></a>And I did not know him. But he who sent me to baptize with water said to me: &lsquo;He over whom you will see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="1v34"></a>And I saw, and I gave testimony: that this one is the Son of God.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v35"></a>The next day again, John was standing with two of his disciples.
<a class="verse" id="1v36"></a>And catching sight of <span class="gold">Jesus</span> walking, he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v37"></a>And two disciples were listening to him speaking. And they followed <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
<a class="verse" id="1v38"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What are you seeking?&rdquo;</span> And they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabbi (which means in translation, Teacher), where do you live?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v39"></a>He said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</span> They went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about the tenth hour.
<a class="verse" id="1v40"></a>And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard about him from John and had followed him.
<a class="verse" id="1v41"></a>First, he found his brother Simon, and he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;We have found the Messiah,&rdquo;</span> (which is translated as the Christ).
<a class="verse" id="1v42"></a>And he led him to <span class="gold">Jesus</span>. And <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, gazing at him, said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You are Simon, son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas,&rdquo;</span> (which is translated as Peter).</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="1v43"></a>On the next day, he wanted to go into Galilee, and he found Philip. And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v44"></a>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
<a class="verse" id="1v45"></a>Philip found Nathanael, and he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the Law and the Prophets: <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v46"></a>And Nathanael said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo;</span> Philip said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v47"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> saw Nathanael coming toward him, and he said about him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold, an Israelite in whom truly there is no deceit.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v48"></a>Nathanael said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;From where do you know me?&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v49"></a>Nathanael answered him and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v50"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe. Greater things than these, you will see.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="1v51"></a>And he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the Angels of God ascending and descending over the Son of man.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="2v2"></a>Now <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was also invited to the wedding, with his disciples.
<a class="verse" id="2v3"></a>And when the wine was failing, <span class="blue">the mother of Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v4"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What is that to me and to you, woman? My hour has not yet arrived.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v5"></a><span class="blue">His mother</span> said to the servants, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v6"></a>Now in that place, there were six stone water jars, for the purification ritual of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.
<a class="verse" id="2v7"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Fill the water jars with water.&rdquo;</span> And they filled them to the very top.
<a class="verse" id="2v8"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Now draw from it, and carry it to the chief steward of the feast.&rdquo;</span> And they took it to him.
<a class="verse" id="2v9"></a>Then, when the chief steward had tasted the water made into wine, since he did not know where it was from, for only the servants who had drawn the water knew, the chief steward called the groom,
<a class="verse" id="2v10"></a>and he said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Every man offers the good wine first, and then, when they have become inebriated, he offers what is worse. But you have kept the good wine until now.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v11"></a>This was the beginning of the signs that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> accomplished in Cana of Galilee, and it manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="2v12"></a>After this, he descended to Capernaum, with <span class="blue">his mother</span> and his brothers and his disciples, but they did not remain there for many days.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="2v13"></a>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and so <span class="gold">Jesus</span> ascended to Jerusalem.
<a class="verse" id="2v14"></a>And he found, sitting in the temple, sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers.
<a class="verse" id="2v15"></a>And when he had made something like a whip out of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the brass coins of the moneychangers, and he overturned their tables.
<a class="verse" id="2v16"></a>And to those who were selling doves, he said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Take these things out of here, and do not make my Father&rsquo;s house into a house of commerce.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v17"></a>And truly, his disciples were reminded that it is written: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Zeal for your house consumes me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v18"></a>Then the Jews responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What sign can you show to us, that you may do these things?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v19"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v20"></a>Then the Jews said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;This temple has been built up over forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="2v21"></a>Yet he was speaking about the Temple of his body.
<a class="verse" id="2v22"></a>Therefore, when he had resurrected from the dead, his disciples were reminded that he had said this, and they believed in the Scriptures and in the word that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had spoken.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="2v23"></a>Now while he was at Jerusalem during the Passover, on the day of the feast, many trusted in his name, seeing his signs that he was accomplishing.
<a class="verse" id="2v24"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> did not trust himself to them, because he himself had knowledge of all persons,
<a class="verse" id="2v25"></a>and because he had no need of anyone to offer testimony about a man. For he knew what was within a man.

<a class="verse" id="3v20"></a>For everyone who does evil hates the Light and does not go toward the Light, so that his works may not be corrected.
<a class="verse" id="3v21"></a>But whoever acts in truth goes toward the Light, so that his works may be manifested, because they have been accomplished in God.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="3v22"></a>After these things, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> and his disciples went into the land of Judea. And he was living there with them and baptizing.
<a class="verse" id="3v23"></a>Now John was also baptizing, at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water in that place. And they were arriving and being baptized.
<a class="verse" id="3v24"></a>For John had not yet been cast into prison.
<a class="verse" id="3v25"></a>Then a dispute occurred between the disciples of John and the Jews, about purification.
<a class="verse" id="3v26"></a>And they went to John and said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you offered testimony: behold, he is baptizing and everyone is going to him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="3v27"></a>John responded and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;A man is not able to receive anything, unless it has been given to him from heaven.
<a class="verse" id="3v28"></a>You yourselves offer testimony for me that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but that I have been sent before him.
<a class="verse" id="3v29"></a>He who holds the bride is the groom. But the friend of the groom, who stands and listens to Him, rejoices joyfully at the voice of the groom. And so, this, my joy, has been fulfilled.
<a class="verse" id="3v30"></a>He must increase, while I must decrease.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="3v31"></a>He who comes from above, is above everything. He who is from below, is of the earth, and he speaks about the earth. He who comes from heaven is above everything.
<a class="verse" id="3v32"></a>And what he has seen and heard, about this he testifies. And no one accepts his testimony.
<a class="verse" id="3v33"></a>Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified that God is truthful.
<a class="verse" id="3v34"></a>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God. For God does not give the Spirit by measure.
<a class="verse" id="3v35"></a>The Father loves the Son, and he has given everything into his hand.
<a class="verse" id="3v36"></a>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. But whoever is unbelieving toward the Son shall not see life; instead the wrath of God remains upon him.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="4v2"></a>(though <span class="gold">Jesus</span> himself was not baptizing, but only his disciples)
<a class="verse" id="4v3"></a>he left behind Judea, and he traveled again to Galilee.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v4"></a>Now he needed to cross through Samaria.
<a class="verse" id="4v5"></a>Therefore, he went into a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the estate which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
<a class="verse" id="4v6"></a>And Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. And so <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, being tired from the journey, was sitting in a certain way on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v7"></a>A woman of Samaria arrived to draw water. <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Give me to drink.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v8"></a>For his disciples had gone into the city in order to buy food.
<a class="verse" id="4v9"></a>And so, that Samaritan woman said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;How is it that you, being a Jew, are requesting a drink from me, though I am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo;</span> For the Jews do not associate with the Samaritans.
<a class="verse" id="4v10"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, &lsquo;Give me to drink,&rsquo; perhaps you would have made a request of him, and he would have given you living water.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v11"></a>The woman said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, you do not have anything with which to draw water, and the well is deep. From where, then, do you have living water?
<a class="verse" id="4v12"></a>Surely, you are not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and who drank from it, with his sons and his cattle?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v13"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;All who drink from this water will thirst again. But whoever shall drink from the water that I will give to him will not thirst for eternity.
<a class="verse" id="4v14"></a>Instead, the water that I will give to him will become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v15"></a>The woman said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, give me this water, so that I may not thirst and may not come here to draw water.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v16"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Go, call your husband, and return here.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v17"></a>The woman responded and said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have no husband.&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You have spoken well, in saying, &lsquo;I have no husband.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="4v18"></a>For you have had five husbands, but he whom you have now is not your husband. You have spoken this in truth.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v19"></a>The woman said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, I see that you are a Prophet.
<a class="verse" id="4v20"></a>Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v21"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you shall worship the Father, neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
<a class="verse" id="4v22"></a>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know. For salvation is from the Jews.
<a class="verse" id="4v23"></a>But the hour is coming, and it is now, when true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeks such persons who may worship him.
<a class="verse" id="4v24"></a>God is Spirit. And so, those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v25"></a>The woman said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I know that the Messiah is coming (who is called the Christ). And then, when he will have arrived, he will announce everything to us.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v26"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am he, the one who is speaking with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v27"></a>And then his disciples arrived. And they wondered that he was speaking with the woman. Yet no one said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What are you seeking?&rdquo;</span> or, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Why are you talking with her?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v28"></a>And so the woman left behind her water jar and went into the city. And she said to the men there:
<a class="verse" id="4v29"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;Come and see a man who has told me all the things that I have done. Is he not the Christ?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v30"></a>Therefore, they went out of the city and came to him.
<a class="verse" id="4v31"></a>Meanwhile, the disciples petitioned him, saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabbi, eat.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v32"></a>But he said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have food to eat which you do not know.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v33"></a>Therefore, the disciples said to one another, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Could someone have brought him something to eat?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v34"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;My food is to do the will of the One who sent me, so that I may perfect his work.
<a class="verse" id="4v35"></a>Do you not say, &lsquo;There are still four months, and then the harvest arrives?&rsquo; Behold, I say to you: Lift up your eyes and look at the countryside; for it is already ripe for the harvest.
<a class="verse" id="4v36"></a>For he who reaps, receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
<a class="verse" id="4v37"></a>For in this the word is true: that it is one who sows, and it is another who reaps.
<a class="verse" id="4v38"></a>I have sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v39"></a>Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him, because of the word of the woman who was offering testimony: <span class="quote">&ldquo;For he told me all the things that I have done.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v40"></a>Therefore, when the Samaritans had come to him, they petitioned him to lodge there. And he lodged there for two days.
<a class="verse" id="4v41"></a>And many more believed in him, because of his own word.
<a class="verse" id="4v42"></a>And they said to the woman: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Now we believe, not because of your speech, but because we ourselves have heard him, and so we know that he is truly the Savior of the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v43"></a>Then, after two days, he departed from there, and he traveled into Galilee.
<a class="verse" id="4v44"></a>For <span class="gold">Jesus</span> himself offered testimony that a Prophet has no honor in his own country.
<a class="verse" id="4v45"></a>And so, when he had arrived in Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all that he had done at Jerusalem, in the day of the feast. For they also went to the feast day.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="4v46"></a>Then he went again into Cana of Galilee, where he made water into wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
<a class="verse" id="4v47"></a>Since he had heard that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> came to Galilee from Judea, he sent to him and begged him to come down and heal his son. For he was beginning to die.
<a class="verse" id="4v48"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Unless you have seen signs and wonders, you do not believe.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v49"></a>The ruler said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, come down before my son dies.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v50"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Go, your son lives.&rdquo;</span> The man believed the word that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> spoke to him, and so he went away.
<a class="verse" id="4v51"></a>Then, as he was going down, his servants met him. And they reported to him, saying that his son was alive.
<a class="verse" id="4v52"></a>Therefore, he asked them at which hour he had become better. And they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="4v53"></a>Then the father realized that it was at the same hour that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Your son lives.&rdquo;</span> And both he and his entire household believed.
<a class="verse" id="4v54"></a>This next sign was the second that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> accomplished, after he had arrived in Galilee from Judea.

<a class="verse" id="5v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">After these things, there was a feast day of the Jews, and so <span class="gold">Jesus</span> ascended to Jerusalem.
<a class="verse" id="5v2"></a>Now at Jerusalem is the Pool of Evidence, which in Hebrew is known as the Place of Mercy; it has five porticos.
<a class="verse" id="5v3"></a>Along these lay a great multitude of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the withered, waiting for the movement of the water.
<a class="verse" id="5v4"></a>Now at times an Angel of the Lord would descend into the pool, and so the water was moved. And whoever descended first into the pool, after the motion of the water, he was healed of whatever infirmity held him.
<a class="verse" id="5v5"></a>And there was a certain man in that place, having been in his infirmity for thirty-eight years.
<a class="verse" id="5v6"></a>Then, when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had seen him reclining, and when he realized that he had been afflicted for a long time, he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you want to be healed?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v7"></a>The invalid answered him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, I do not have any man to put me in the pool, when the water has been stirred. For as I am going, another descends ahead of me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v8"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rise, take up your stretcher, and walk.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v9"></a>And immediately the man was healed. And he took up his stretcher and walked. </p>
<p class="normal">Now this day was the Sabbath.
<a class="verse" id="5v10"></a>Therefore, the Jews said to the one who had been healed: <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up your stretcher.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v11"></a>He answered them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;The one who healed me, he said to me, &lsquo;Take up your stretcher and walk.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v12"></a>Therefore, they questioned him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who is that man, who said to you, &lsquo;Take up your bed and walk?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v13"></a>But the one who had been given health did not know who it was. For <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had turned aside from the crowd gathered in that place.
<a class="verse" id="5v14"></a>Afterwards, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> found him in the temple, and he said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold, you have been healed. Do not choose to sin further, otherwise something worse may happen to you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v15"></a>This man went away, and he reported to the Jews that it was <span class="gold">Jesus</span> who had given him health.
<a class="verse" id="5v16"></a>Because of this, the Jews were persecuting <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, for he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
<a class="verse" id="5v17"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Even now, my Father is working, and I am working.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="5v18"></a>And so, because of this, the Jews were seeking to kill him even more so. For not only did he break the Sabbath, but he even said that God was his Father, making himself equal to God.
<a class="verse" id="5v19"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to them: </p>
<p class="normal hang"><span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything of himself, but only what he has seen the Father doing. For whatever he does, even this does the Son do, similarly.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v20"></a>For the Father loves the Son, and he shows him all that he himself does. And greater works than these will he show him, so much so that you shall wonder.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v21"></a>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so also does the Son give life to whomever he wills.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v22"></a>For the Father does not judge anyone. But he has given all judgment to the Son,

<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v23"></a>so that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v24"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, that whoever hears my word, and believes in him who sent me, has eternal life, and he does not go into judgment, but instead he crosses from death into life.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v25"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, that the hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear it shall live.

<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v26"></a>For just as the Father has life in himself, so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v27"></a>And he has given him the authority to accomplish judgment. For he is the Son of man.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v28"></a>Do not be amazed at this. For the hour is coming in which all who are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Son of God.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v29"></a>And those who have done good shall go forth to the resurrection of life. Yet truly, those who have done evil shall go to the resurrection of judgment.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v30"></a>I am not able to do anything of myself. As I hear, so do I judge. And my judgment is just. For I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v31"></a>If I offer testimony about myself, my testimony is not true.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v32"></a>There is another who offers testimony about me, and I know that the testimony which he offers about me is true.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v33"></a>You sent to John, and he offered testimony to the truth.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v34"></a>But I do not accept testimony from man. Instead, I say these things, so that you may be saved.
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="5v35"></a>He was a burning and shining light. So you were willing, at the time, to exult in his light.
</p>

<a class="verse" id="6v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">After these things, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> traveled across the sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.
<a class="verse" id="6v2"></a>And a great multitude was following him, for they saw the signs that he was accomplishing toward those who were infirm.
<a class="verse" id="6v3"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> went onto a mountain, and he sat down there with his disciples.
<a class="verse" id="6v4"></a>Now the Passover, the feast day of the Jews, was near.
<a class="verse" id="6v5"></a>And so, when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had lifted up his eyes and had seen that a very great multitude came to him, he said to Philip, <span class="quote">&ldquo;From where should we buy bread, so that these may eat?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v6"></a>But he said this to test him. For he himself knew what he would do.
<a class="verse" id="6v7"></a>Philip answered him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Two hundred denarii of bread would not be sufficient for each of them to receive even a little.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v8"></a>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
<a class="verse" id="6v9"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;There is a certain boy here, who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are these among so many?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v10"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Have the men sit down to eat.&rdquo;</span> Now, there was much grass in that place. And so the men, in number about five thousand, sat down to eat.
<a class="verse" id="6v11"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> took the bread, and when he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting down to eat; similarly also, from the fish, as much as they wanted.
<a class="verse" id="6v12"></a>Then, when they were filled, he said to his disciples, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Gather the fragments that are left over, lest they be lost.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v13"></a>And so they gathered, and they filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which were left over from those who had eaten.
<a class="verse" id="6v14"></a>Therefore, those men, when they had seen that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had accomplished a sign, they said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Truly, this one is the Prophet who is to come into the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v15"></a>And so, when he realized that they were going to come and take him away and make him king, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> fled back to the mountain, by himself alone.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v16"></a>Then, when evening arrived, his disciples descended to the sea.
<a class="verse" id="6v17"></a>And when they had climbed into a boat, they went across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had now arrived, and <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had not returned to them.
<a class="verse" id="6v18"></a>Then the sea was stirred up by a great wind that was blowing.
<a class="verse" id="6v19"></a>And so, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw <span class="gold">Jesus</span> walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat, and they were afraid.
<a class="verse" id="6v20"></a>But he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is I. Do not be afraid.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v21"></a>Therefore, they were willing to receive him into the boat. But immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v22"></a>On the next day, the crowd which was standing across the sea saw that there were no other small boats in that place, except one, and that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had not entered into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had departed alone.
<a class="verse" id="6v23"></a>Yet truly, other boats came over from Tiberias, next to the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks.
<a class="verse" id="6v24"></a>Therefore, when the crowd had seen that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was not there, nor his disciples, they climbed into the small boats, and they went to Capernaum, seeking <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v25"></a>And when they had found him across the sea, they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v26"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered them and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen signs, but because you have eaten from the bread and were satisfied.
<a class="verse" id="6v27"></a>Do not work for food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v28"></a>Therefore, they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What should we do, so that we may labor in the works of God?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v29"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he sent.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v30"></a>And so they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Then what sign will you do, so that we may see it and believe in you? What will you work?
<a class="verse" id="6v31"></a>Our fathers ate manna in the desert, just as it has been written, &lsquo;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v32"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
<a class="verse" id="6v33"></a>For the bread of God is he who descends from heaven and gives life to the world.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v34"></a>And so they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, give us this bread always.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v35"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
<a class="verse" id="6v36"></a>But I say to you, that even though you have seen me, you do not believe.
<a class="verse" id="6v37"></a>All that the Father gives to me shall come to me. And whoever comes to me, I will not cast out.
<a class="verse" id="6v38"></a>For I descended from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
<a class="verse" id="6v39"></a>Yet this is the will of the Father who sent me: that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given to me, but that I should raise them up on the last day.
<a class="verse" id="6v40"></a>So then, this is the will of my Father who sent me: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v41"></a>Therefore, the Jews murmured about him, because he had said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am the living bread, who descended from heaven.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v42"></a>And they said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Is this not <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? Then how can he say: &lsquo;For I descended from heaven?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v43"></a>And so <span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do not choose to murmur among yourselves.
<a class="verse" id="6v44"></a>No one is able to come to me, unless the Father, who has sent me, has drawn him. And I will raise him up on the last day.
<a class="verse" id="6v45"></a>It has been written in the Prophets: &lsquo;And they shall all be taught by God.&rsquo; Everyone who has listened and learned from the Father comes to me.
<a class="verse" id="6v46"></a>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God; this one has seen the Father.
<a class="verse" id="6v47"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.
<a class="verse" id="6v48"></a>I am the bread of life.
<a class="verse" id="6v49"></a>Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and they died.
<a class="verse" id="6v50"></a>This is the bread which descends from heaven, so that if anyone will eat from it, he may not die.
<a class="verse" id="6v51"></a>I am the living bread, who descended from heaven.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v52"></a>If anyone eats from this bread, he shall live in eternity. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v53"></a>Therefore, the Jews debated among themselves, saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v54"></a>And so, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you.
<a class="verse" id="6v55"></a>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
<a class="verse" id="6v56"></a>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
<a class="verse" id="6v57"></a>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
<a class="verse" id="6v58"></a>Just as the living Father has sent me and I live because of the Father, so also whoever eats me, the same shall live because of me.
<a class="verse" id="6v59"></a>This is the bread that descends from heaven. It is not like the manna that your fathers ate, for they died. Whoever eats this bread shall live forever.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v60"></a>He said these things when he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.
<a class="verse" id="6v61"></a>Therefore, many of his disciples, upon hearing this, said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;This saying is difficult,&rdquo;</span> and, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who is able to listen to it?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v62"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, knowing within himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Does this offend you?
<a class="verse" id="6v63"></a>Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending to where he was before?
<a class="verse" id="6v64"></a>It is the Spirit who gives life. The flesh does not offer anything of benefit. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
<a class="verse" id="6v65"></a>But there are some among you who do not believe.&rdquo;</span> For <span class="gold">Jesus</span> knew from the beginning who were unbelieving and which one would betray him.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="6v66"></a>And so he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;For this reason, I said to you that no one is able to come to me, unless it has been given to him by my Father.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v67"></a>After this, many of his disciples went back, and they no longer walked with him.
<a class="verse" id="6v68"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to the twelve, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v69"></a>Then Simon Peter answered him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
<a class="verse" id="6v70"></a>And we have believed, and we recognize that you are the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v71"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Have I not chosen you twelve? And yet one among you is a devil.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="6v72"></a>Now he was speaking about Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. For this one, even though he was one of the twelve, was about to betray him.

<a class="verse" id="7v2"></a>Now the feast day of the Jews, the Feast of Tabernacles, was near.
<a class="verse" id="7v3"></a>And his brothers said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Move away from here and go into Judea, so that your disciples there may also see your works that you do.
<a class="verse" id="7v4"></a>Of course, no one does anything in secret, but he himself seeks to be in the public view. Since you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v5"></a>For neither did his brothers believe in him.
<a class="verse" id="7v6"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;My time has not yet come; but your time is always at hand.
<a class="verse" id="7v7"></a>The world cannot hate you. But it hates me, because I offer testimony about it, that its works are evil.

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v10"></a>But after his brothers went up, then he also went up to the feast day, not openly, but as if in secret.

<a class="verse" id="7v12"></a>And there was much murmuring in the crowd concerning him. For certain ones were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;He is good.&rdquo;</span> But others were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;No, for he seduces the crowds.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="7v22"></a>For Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers) and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.
<a class="verse" id="7v23"></a>If a man can receive circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you indignant toward me, because I have made a man whole on the Sabbath?
<a class="verse" id="7v24"></a>Do not judge according to appearances, but instead judge a just judgment.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v25"></a>Therefore, some of those from Jerusalem said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Is he not the one whom they are seeking to kill?
<a class="verse" id="7v26"></a>And behold, he is speaking openly, and they say nothing to him. Could the leaders have decided that it is true this one is the Christ?
<a class="verse" id="7v27"></a>But we know him and where he is from. And when the Christ has arrived, no one will know where he is from.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v28"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> cried out in the temple, teaching and saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You know me, and you also know where I am from. And I have not arrived of myself, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.
<a class="verse" id="7v29"></a>I know him. For I am from him, and he has sent me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v30"></a>Therefore, they were seeking to apprehend him, and yet no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
<a class="verse" id="7v31"></a>But many among the crowd believed in him, and they were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;When the Christ arrives, will he perform more signs than this man does?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v32"></a>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him. And the leaders and the Pharisees sent attendants to apprehend him.
<a class="verse" id="7v33"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;For a brief time, I am still with you, and then I am going to him who sent me.
<a class="verse" id="7v34"></a>You shall seek me, and you will not find me. And where I am, you are not able to go.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v35"></a>And so the Jews said among themselves: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Where is this place to which he will go, such that we will not find him? Will he go to those dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?
<a class="verse" id="7v36"></a>What is this word that he spoke, &lsquo;You will seek me and you will not find me; and where I am, you are not able to go?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v37"></a>Then, on the last great day of the feast, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was standing and crying out, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink:
<a class="verse" id="7v38"></a>whoever believes in me, just as Scripture says, &lsquo;From his chest shall flow rivers of living water.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v39"></a>Now he said this about the Spirit, which those who believe in him would soon be receiving. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had not yet been glorified.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v40"></a>Therefore, some from that crowd, when they had heard these words of his, were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;This one truly is the Prophet.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v41"></a>Others were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;He is the Christ.&rdquo;</span> Yet certain ones were saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Does the Christ come from Galilee?
<a class="verse" id="7v42"></a>Does Scripture not say that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v43"></a>And so there arose a dissension among the multitude because of him.
<a class="verse" id="7v44"></a>Now certain ones among them wanted to apprehend him, but no one laid hands upon him.</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="7v45"></a>Therefore, the attendants went to the high priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Why have you not brought him?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v46"></a>The attendants responded, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Never has a man spoken like this man.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v47"></a>And so the Pharisees answered them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Have you also been seduced?
<a class="verse" id="7v48"></a>Have any of the leaders believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?
<a class="verse" id="7v49"></a>But this crowd, which does not know the law, they are accursed.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v50"></a>Nicodemus, the one who came to him by night and who was one of them, said to them,
<a class="verse" id="7v51"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;Does our law judge a man, unless it has first heard him and has known what he has done?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v52"></a>They responded and said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are you also a Galilean? Study the Scriptures, and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="7v53"></a>And each one returned to his own house.

<a class="verse" id="8v2"></a>And early in the morning, he went again to the temple; and all the people came to him. And sitting down, he taught them.
<a class="verse" id="8v3"></a>Now the scribes and Pharisees brought forward a woman caught in adultery, and they stood her in front of them.
<a class="verse" id="8v4"></a>And they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Teacher, this woman was just now caught in adultery.
<a class="verse" id="8v5"></a>And in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such a one. Therefore, what do you say?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v6"></a>But they were saying this to test him, so that they might be able to accuse him. Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> bent down and wrote with his finger on the earth.
<a class="verse" id="8v7"></a>And then, when they persevered in questioning him, he stood upright and said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Let whoever is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="8v14"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Even though I offer testimony about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going.
<a class="verse" id="8v15"></a>You judge according to the flesh. I do not judge anyone.
<a class="verse" id="8v16"></a>And when I do judge, my judgment is true. For I am not alone, but it is I and he who sent me: the Father.

<a class="verse" id="8v33"></a>They answered him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;We are the offspring of Abraham, and we have never been a slave to anyone. How can you say, &lsquo;You shall be set free?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="8v34"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.

<a class="verse" id="8v37"></a>I know that you are sons of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word has not taken hold in you.
<a class="verse" id="8v38"></a>I speak what I have seen with my Father. And you do what you have seen with your father.&rdquo;</span>

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="8v39"></a>They responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If you are the sons of Abraham, then do the works of Abraham.

<a class="verse" id="8v41"></a>You do the works of your father.&rdquo;</span> Therefore, they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;We were not born out of fornication. We have one father: God.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v42"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If God were your father, certainly you would love me. For I proceeded and came from God. For I did not come from myself, but he sent me.
<a class="verse" id="8v43"></a>Why do you not recognize my speech? It is because you are not able to hear my word.
<a class="verse" id="8v44"></a>You are of your father, the devil. And you will carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning. And he did not stand in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks it from his own self. For he is a liar, and the father of lies.
<a class="verse" id="8v45"></a>But if I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
<a class="verse" id="8v46"></a>Which of you can convict me of sin? If I speak the truth to you, why do you not believe me?
<a class="verse" id="8v47"></a>Whoever is of God, hears the words of God. For this reason, you do not hear them: because you are not of God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="8v48"></a>Therefore, the Jews responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan, and that you have a demon?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v49"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I do not have a demon. But I honor my Father, and you have dishonored me.
<a class="verse" id="8v50"></a>But I am not seeking my own glory. There is One who seeks and judges.
<a class="verse" id="8v51"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, if anyone will have kept my word, he will not see death for eternity.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v52"></a>Therefore, the Jews said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets; and yet you say, &lsquo;If anyone will have kept my word, he shall not taste death for eternity.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="8v53"></a>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. So who do you make yourself to be?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v54"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me. And you say about him that he is your God.
<a class="verse" id="8v55"></a>And yet you have not known him. But I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, then I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.
<a class="verse" id="8v56"></a>Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it and was glad.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v57"></a>And so the Jews said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You have not yet reached fifty years, and you have seen Abraham?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v58"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="8v59"></a>Therefore, they took up stones to cast at him. But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> hid himself, and he departed from the temple.

<a class="verse" id="9v17"></a>Therefore, they spoke again to the blind man, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What do you say about him who opened your eyes?&rdquo;</span> Then he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;He is a Prophet.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="9v18"></a>Therefore, the Jews did not believe, about him, that he had been blind and had seen, until they called the parents of him who had seen.
<a class="verse" id="9v19"></a>And they questioned them, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how is it that he now sees?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v20"></a>His parents responded to them and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
<a class="verse" id="9v21"></a>But how it is that he now sees, we do not know. And who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough. Let him speak for himself.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v22"></a>His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already conspired, so that if anyone were to confess him to be the Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.
<a class="verse" id="9v23"></a>It was for this reason that his parents said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;He is old enough. Ask him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="9v24"></a>Therefore, they again called the man who had been blind, and they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v25"></a>And so he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If he is a sinner, I do not know it. One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v26"></a>Then they said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v27"></a>He answered them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have already told you, and you heard it. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v28"></a>Therefore, they cursed him and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You be his disciple. But we are disciples of Moses.
<a class="verse" id="9v29"></a>We know that God spoke to Moses. But this man, we do not know where he is from.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v30"></a>The man responded and said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Now in this is a wonder: that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.
<a class="verse" id="9v31"></a>And we know that God does not hear sinners. But if anyone is a worshipper of God and does his will, then he heeds him.
<a class="verse" id="9v32"></a>From ancient times, it has not been heard that anyone has opened the eyes of someone born blind.
<a class="verse" id="9v33"></a>Unless this man were of God, he would not be able to do any such thing.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v34"></a>They responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You were born entirely in sins, and you would teach us?&rdquo;</span> And they cast him out.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="9v35"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of God?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v36"></a>He responded and said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who is he, Lord, so that I may believe in him?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v37"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v38"></a>And he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I believe, Lord.&rdquo;</span> And falling prostrate, he worshipped him.
<a class="verse" id="9v39"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I came into this world in judgment, so that those who do not see, may see; and so that those who see, may become blind.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v40"></a>And certain Pharisees, who were with him, heard this, and they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are we also blind?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="9v41"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If you were blind, you would not have sin. Yet now you say, &lsquo;We see.&rsquo; So your sin persists.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="10v18"></a>No one takes it away from me. Instead, I lay it down of my own accord. And I have the power to lay it down. And I have the power to take it up again. This is the commandment that I have received from my Father.&rdquo;</span>

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="10v19"></a>A dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words.

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="10v22"></a>Now it was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.

<a class="verse" id="10v34"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Is it not written in your law, &lsquo;I said: you are gods?&rsquo;

<a class="verse" id="10v38"></a>But if I do them, even if you are not willing to believe in me, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="10v39"></a>Therefore, they sought to apprehend him, but he escaped from their hands.

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="10v40"></a>And he went again across the Jordan, to that place where John first was baptizing. And he lodged there.

<a class="verse" id="11v11"></a>He said these things, and after this, he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lazarus our friend is sleeping. But I am going, so that I may awaken him from sleep.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="11v27"></a>She said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Certainly, Lord. I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God, who has come into this world.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="11v31"></a>Therefore, the Jews who were with her in the house and who were consoling her, when they had seen that Mary rose up quickly and went out, they followed her, saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;She is going to the tomb, so that she may weep there.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v32"></a>Therefore, when Mary had arrived to where <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and she said to him. <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v33"></a>And then, when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> saw her weeping, and the Jews who had arrived with her weeping, he groaned in spirit and became troubled.

<a class="verse" id="11v35"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> wept.
<a class="verse" id="11v36"></a>Therefore, the Jews said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;See how much he loved him!&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v37"></a>But some of them said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Would not he who opened the eyes of one born blind have been able to cause this man not to die?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="11v38"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, again groaning from within himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone had been placed over it.
<a class="verse" id="11v39"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Take away the stone.&rdquo;</span> Martha, the sister of him who had died, said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, by now it will smell, for this is the fourth day.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v40"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Did I not say to you that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v41"></a>Therefore, they took away the stone. Then, lifting up his eyes, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Father, I give thanks to you because you have heard me.
<a class="verse" id="11v42"></a>And I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the people who are standing nearby, so that they may believe that you have sent me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v43"></a>When he had said these things, he cried in a loud voice, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lazarus, come out.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v44"></a>And immediately, he who had been dead went forth, bound at the feet and hands with winding bands. And his face was bound with a separate cloth. <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Release him and let him go.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="11v45"></a>Therefore, many of the Jews, who had come to Mary and Martha, and who had seen the things that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> did, believed in him.
<a class="verse" id="11v46"></a>But certain ones among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had done.
<a class="verse" id="11v47"></a>And so, the high priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and they were saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What can we do? For this man accomplishes many signs.
<a class="verse" id="11v48"></a>If we leave him alone, in this way all will believe in him. And then the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v49"></a>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, since he was the high priest that year, said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You do not understand anything.
<a class="verse" id="11v50"></a>Nor do you realize that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the entire nation should not perish.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v51"></a>Yet he did not say this from himself, but since he was the high priest that year, he prophesied that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> would die for the nation.
<a class="verse" id="11v52"></a>And not only for the nation, but in order to gather together as one the children of God who have been dispersed.
<a class="verse" id="11v53"></a>Therefore, from that day, they planned to put him to death.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="11v54"></a>And so, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> no longer walked in public with the Jews. But he went into a region near the desert, to a city which is called Ephraim. And he lodged there with his disciples.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="11v55"></a>Now the Passover of the Jews was near. And many from the countryside ascended to Jerusalem before the Passover, so that they might sanctify themselves.
<a class="verse" id="11v56"></a>Therefore, they were seeking <span class="gold">Jesus</span>. And they conferred with one another, while standing in the temple: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What do you think? Will he come to the feast day?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="11v57"></a>And the high priests and Pharisees had given an order, so that if anyone would know where he may be, he should reveal it, so that they might apprehend him.

<p class="normal dropT">
<a class="verse" id="12v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">Then six days before the Passover, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> went to Bethania, where Lazarus had died, whom <span class="gold">Jesus</span> raised up.
<a class="verse" id="12v2"></a>And they made a dinner for him there. And Martha was ministering. And truly, Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at table with him.
<a class="verse" id="12v3"></a>And then Mary took twelve ounces of pure spikenard ointment, very precious, and she anointed the feet of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, and she wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
<a class="verse" id="12v4"></a>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was soon to betray him, said,
<a class="verse" id="12v5"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the needy?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v6"></a>Now he said this, not out of concern for the needy, but because he was a thief and, since he held the purse, he used to carry what was put into it.
<a class="verse" id="12v7"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Permit her, so that she may keep it against the day of my burial.
<a class="verse" id="12v8"></a>For the poor, you have with you always. But me, you do always not have.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v9"></a>Now a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was in that place, and so they came, not so much because of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, but so that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
<a class="verse" id="12v10"></a>And the leaders of the priests planned to put Lazarus to death also.
<a class="verse" id="12v11"></a>For many of the Jews, because of him, were going away and were believing in <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v12"></a>Then, on the next day, the great crowd that had come to the feast day, when they had heard that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was coming to Jerusalem,
<a class="verse" id="12v13"></a>took branches of palm trees, and they went ahead to meet him. And they were crying out: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Hosanna! Blessed is he who arrives in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v14"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> found a small donkey, and he sat upon it, just as it is written:
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="12v15"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your king arrives, sitting on the colt of a donkey.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v16"></a>At first, his disciples did not realize these things. But when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that these things happened to him.
<a class="verse" id="12v17"></a>And so the crowd that had been with him, when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, offered testimony.
<a class="verse" id="12v18"></a>Because of this, too, the crowd went out to meet him. For they heard that he had accomplished this sign.
<a class="verse" id="12v19"></a>Therefore, the Pharisees said among themselves: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you see that we are accomplishing nothing? Behold, the entire world has gone after him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v20"></a>Now there were certain Gentiles among those who went up so that they might worship on the feast day.
<a class="verse" id="12v21"></a>Therefore, these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they petitioned him, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Sir, we want to see <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v22"></a>Philip went and told Andrew. Next, Andrew and Philip told <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
<a class="verse" id="12v23"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered them by saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;The hour arrives when the Son of man shall be glorified.
<a class="verse" id="12v24"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
<a class="verse" id="12v25"></a>it remains alone. But if it dies, it yields much fruit. Whoever loves his life, will lose it. And whoever hates his life in this world, preserves it unto eternal life.
<a class="verse" id="12v26"></a>If anyone serves me, let him follow me. And where I am, there too my minister shall be. If anyone has served me, my Father will honor him.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v27"></a>Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say? Father, save me from this hour? But it is for this reason that I came to this hour.
<a class="verse" id="12v28"></a>Father, glorify your name!&rdquo;</span> And then a voice came from heaven, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v29"></a>Therefore, the crowd, which was standing near and had heard it, said that it was like thunder. Others were saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;An Angel was speaking with him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v30"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;This voice came, not for my sake, but for your sakes.
<a class="verse" id="12v31"></a>Now is the judgment of the world. Now will the prince of this world be cast out.
<a class="verse" id="12v32"></a>And when I have been lifted up from the earth, I will draw all things to myself.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v33"></a>(Now he said this, signifying what kind of death he would die.)
<a class="verse" id="12v34"></a>The crowd answered him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;We have heard, from the law, that the Christ remains forever. And so how can you say, &lsquo;The Son of man must be lifted up?&rsquo; Who is this Son of man?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="12v35"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;For a brief time, the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. But whoever walks in darkness does not know where is he going.
<a class="verse" id="12v36"></a>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may be sons of the Light.&rdquo;</span> 
</p>
<p class="normal"><span class="gold">Jesus</span> spoke these things, and then he went away and hid himself from them.
<a class="verse" id="12v37"></a>And although he had done such great signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,
<a class="verse" id="12v38"></a>so that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which says: 
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, who has believed in our hearing? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v39"></a>Because of this, they were not able to believe, for Isaiah said again:
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><a class="verse" id="12v40"></a><span class="quote">&ldquo;He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, so that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted: and then I would heal them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v41"></a>These things Isaiah said, when he saw his glory and was speaking about him.
<a class="verse" id="12v42"></a>Yet truly, many of the leaders also believed in him. But because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him, so that they would not be cast out of the synagogue.
<a class="verse" id="12v43"></a>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="12v44"></a>But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> cried out and said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Whoever believes in me, does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.
<a class="verse" id="12v45"></a>And whoever sees me, sees him who sent me.
<a class="verse" id="12v46"></a>I have arrived as a light to the world, so that all who believe in me might not remain in darkness.
<a class="verse" id="12v47"></a>And if anyone has heard my words and not kept them, I do not judge him. For I did not come so that I may judge the world, but so that I may save the world.
<a class="verse" id="12v48"></a>Whoever despises me and does not accept my words has one who judges him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him on the last day.
<a class="verse" id="12v49"></a>For I am not speaking from myself, but from the Father who sent me. He gave a commandment to me as to what I should say and how I should speak.
<a class="verse" id="12v50"></a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore, the things that I speak, just as the Father has said to me, so also do I speak.&rdquo;</span>

<p class="normal dropB">
<a class="verse" id="13v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">Before the feast day of the Passover, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> knew that the hour was approaching when he would pass from this world to the Father. And since he had always loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
<a class="verse" id="13v2"></a>And when the meal had taken place, when the devil had now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,
<a class="verse" id="13v3"></a>knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God,
<a class="verse" id="13v4"></a>he rose up from the meal, and he set aside his vestments, and when he had received a towel, he wrapped it around himself.
<a class="verse" id="13v5"></a>Next he put water into a shallow bowl, and he began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he was wrapped.
<a class="verse" id="13v6"></a>And then he came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, would you wash my feet?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v7"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded and said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;What I am doing, you do not now understand. But you shall understand it afterward.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v8"></a>Peter said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You shall never wash my feet!&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;If I do not wash you, you will have no place with me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v9"></a>Simon Peter said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Then Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v10"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;He who is washed need only wash his feet, and then he will be entirely clean. And you are clean, but not all.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v11"></a>For he knew which one would betray him. For this reason, he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You are not all clean.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="13v12"></a>And so, after he washed their feet and received his vestments, when he had sat down at table again, he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you know what I have done for you?
<a class="verse" id="13v13"></a>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you speak well: for so I am.
<a class="verse" id="13v14"></a>Therefore, if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another.
<a class="verse" id="13v15"></a>For I have given you an example, so that just as I have done for you, so also should you do.
<a class="verse" id="13v16"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, and the apostle is not greater than he who sent him.
<a class="verse" id="13v17"></a>If you understand this, you shall be blessed if you will do it.
<a class="verse" id="13v18"></a>I am not speaking about all of you. I know those whom I have chosen. But this is so that the Scripture may be fulfilled, &lsquo;He who eats bread with me shall lift up his heel against me.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="13v19"></a>And I tell you this now, before it happens, so that when it has happened, you may believe that I am.
<a class="verse" id="13v20"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever receives anyone whom I send, receives me. And whoever receives me, receives him who sent me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="13v21"></a>When <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had said these things, he was troubled in spirit. And he bore witness by saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, that one among you shall betray me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v22"></a>Therefore, the disciples looked around at one another, uncertain about whom he spoke.
<a class="verse" id="13v23"></a>And leaning against the bosom of <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was one of his disciples, <span class="red">the one whom Jesus loved</span>.
<a class="verse" id="13v24"></a>Therefore, Simon Peter motioned to this one and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who is it that he is speaking about?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v25"></a>And so, leaning against the chest of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v26"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded, <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is he to whom I shall extend the dipped bread.&rdquo;</span> And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
<a class="verse" id="13v27"></a>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What you are going to do, do quickly.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v28"></a>Now none of those sitting at table knew why he had said this to him.
<a class="verse" id="13v29"></a>For some were thinking that, because Judas held the purse, that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had told him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Buy those things which are needed by us for the feast day,&rdquo;</span> or that he might give something to the needy.
<a class="verse" id="13v30"></a>Therefore, having accepted the morsel, he went out immediately. And it was night.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="13v31"></a>Then, when he had gone out, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Now the Son of man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
<a class="verse" id="13v32"></a>If God has been glorified in him, then God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him without delay.
<a class="verse" id="13v33"></a>Little sons, for a brief while, I am with you. You shall seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, &lsquo;Where I am going, you are not able to go,&rsquo; so also I say to you now.
<a class="verse" id="13v34"></a>I give you a new commandment: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, so also must you love one another.
<a class="verse" id="13v35"></a>By this, all shall recognize that you are my disciples: if you will have love for one another.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="13v36"></a>Simon Peter said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Where I am going, you are not able to follow me now. But you shall follow afterward.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="13v37"></a>Peter said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Why am I unable to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="18v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">When <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had said these things, he departed with his disciples across the Torrent of Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.
<a class="verse" id="18v2"></a>But Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had frequently met with his disciples there.
<a class="verse" id="18v3"></a>Then Judas, when he had received a cohort from both the high priests and the attendants of the Pharisees, approached the place with lanterns and torches and weapons.
<a class="verse" id="18v4"></a>And so <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, knowing all that was about to happen to him, advanced and said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you seeking?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v5"></a>They answered him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="gold">Jesus</span> the Nazarene.&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am he.&rdquo;</span> Now Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with them.
<a class="verse" id="18v6"></a>Then, when he said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo;</span> they moved back and fell to the ground.
<a class="verse" id="18v7"></a>Then again he questioned them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you seeking?&rdquo;</span> And they said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="gold">Jesus</span> the Nazarene.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v8"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I told you that I am he. Therefore, if you are seeking me, permit these others to go away.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v9"></a>This was so that the word might be fulfilled, which he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Of those whom you have given to me, I have not lost any of them.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v10"></a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and he struck the servant of the high priest, and he cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.
<a class="verse" id="18v11"></a>Therefore, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to Peter: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Set your sword into the scabbard. Should I not drink the chalice which my Father has given to me?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v12"></a>Then the cohort, and the tribune, and the attendants of the Jews apprehended <span class="gold">Jesus</span> and bound him.
<a class="verse" id="18v13"></a>And they led him away, first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
<a class="verse" id="18v14"></a>Now Caiaphas was the one who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v15"></a>And Simon Peter was following <span class="gold">Jesus</span> with another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and so he entered with <span class="gold">Jesus</span> into the court of the high priest.
<a class="verse" id="18v16"></a>But Peter was standing outside at the entrance. Therefore, the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who was the doorkeeper, and he led in Peter.
<a class="verse" id="18v17"></a>Therefore, the woman servant keeping the door said to Peter, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are you not also among the disciples of this man?&rdquo;</span> He said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v18"></a>Now the servants and attendants were standing before burning coals, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was standing with them also, warming himself.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v19"></a>Then the high priest questioned <span class="gold">Jesus</span> about his disciples and about his doctrine.
<a class="verse" id="18v20"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews meet. And I have said nothing in secret.
<a class="verse" id="18v21"></a>Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said to them. Behold, they know these things that I have said.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v22"></a>Then, when he had said this, one of the attendants standing nearby struck <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Is this the way you answer the high priest?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v23"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, offer testimony about the wrong. But if I have spoken correctly, then why do you strike me?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v24"></a>And Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v25"></a>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are you not also one of his disciples?&rdquo;</span> He denied it and said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v26"></a>One of the servants of the high priest (a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off) said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v27"></a>Therefore, again, Peter denied it. And immediately the rooster crowed.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v28"></a>Then they led <span class="gold">Jesus</span> from Caiaphas into the praetorium. Now it was morning, and so they did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
<a class="verse" id="18v29"></a>Therefore, Pilate went outside to them, and he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What accusation are you bringing against this man?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v30"></a>They responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;If he were not an evil-doer, we would not have handed him over to you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v31"></a>Therefore, Pilate said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your own law.&rdquo;</span> Then the Jews said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is not lawful for us to execute anyone.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v32"></a>This was so that the word of <span class="gold">Jesus</span> would be fulfilled, which he spoke signifying what kind of death he would die.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="18v33"></a>Then Pilate entered the praetorium again, and he called <span class="gold">Jesus</span> and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You are the king of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v34"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Are you saying this of yourself, or have others spoken to you about me?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v35"></a>Pilate responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v36"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> responded: <span class="quote">&ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my ministers would certainly strive so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not now from here.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v37"></a>And so Pilate said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You are a king, then?&rdquo;</span> <span class="gold">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="quote">&ldquo;You are saying that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world: so that I may offer testimony to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v38"></a>Pilate said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;</span> 
</p>
<p class="normal">And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and he said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I find no case against him.
<a class="verse" id="18v39"></a>But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="18v40"></a>Then they all cried out repeatedly, saying: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Not this one, but Barabbas.&rdquo;</span> Now Barabbas was a robber.

<a class="verse" id="19v2"></a>And the soldiers, plaiting a crown of thorns, imposed it on his head. And they put a purple garment around him.
<a class="verse" id="19v3"></a>And they were approaching him and saying, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Hail, king of the Jews!&rdquo;</span> And they struck him repeatedly.
<a class="verse" id="19v4"></a>Then Pilate went outside again, and he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may realize that I find no case against him.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="19v7"></a>The Jews answered him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;We have a law, and according to the law, he ought to die, for he has made himself the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="19v10"></a>Therefore, Pilate said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?&rdquo;</span>

<a class="verse" id="19v13"></a>Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought <span class="gold">Jesus</span> outside, and he sat down in the seat of judgment, in a place which is called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, it is called the Elevation.

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="19v17"></a>And carrying his own cross, he went forth to the place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew it is called the Place of the Skull.

<a class="verse" id="19v19"></a>Then Pilate also wrote a title, and he set it above the cross. And it was written: <span class="gold">Jesus</span> THE NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS.
<a class="verse" id="19v20"></a>Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, for the place where <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was crucified was close to the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.
<a class="verse" id="19v21"></a>Then the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Do not write, &lsquo;King of the Jews,&rsquo; but that he said, &lsquo;I am King of the Jews.&rsquo;
<a class="verse" id="19v22"></a>Pilate responded, <span class="quote">&ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</span>

<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="19v23"></a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified him, took his garments, and they made four parts, one part to each soldier, and the tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven from above throughout the whole.
<a class="verse" id="19v24"></a>Then they said to one another, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Let us not cut it, but instead let us cast lots over it, to see whose it will be.&rdquo;</span> This was so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, saying: 
</p>
<p class="normal hang"><span class="quote">&ldquo;They have distributed my garments among themselves, 
<br/>and for my vesture they have cast lots.&rdquo;</span> 
</p>
<p class="normal">And indeed, the soldiers did these things.
<a class="verse" id="19v25"></a>And standing beside the cross of <span class="gold">Jesus</span> were <span class="blue">his mother</span>, and his mother&rsquo;s sister, and Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
<a class="verse" id="19v26"></a>Therefore, when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had seen <span class="blue">his mother</span> and <span class="red">the disciple whom he loved</span> standing near, he said to <span class="blue">his mother</span>, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Woman, behold your son.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="19v27"></a>Next, he said to the disciple, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Behold your mother.&rdquo;</span> And from that hour, the disciple accepted her as his own.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="19v28"></a>After this, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> knew that all had been accomplished, so in order that the Scripture might be completed, he said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="19v29"></a>And there was a container placed there, full of vinegar. Then, placing a sponge full of vinegar around hyssop, they brought it to his mouth.
<a class="verse" id="19v30"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, when he had received the vinegar, said: <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is consummated.&rdquo;</span> And bowing down his head, he surrendered his spirit.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="19v31"></a>Then the Jews, because it was the preparation day, so that the bodies would not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), they petitioned Pilate in order that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.
<a class="verse" id="19v32"></a>Therefore, the soldiers approached, and, indeed, they broke the legs of the first one, and of the other who was crucified with him.
<a class="verse" id="19v33"></a>But after they had approached <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
<a class="verse" id="19v34"></a>Instead, one of the soldiers opened his side with a lance, and immediately there went out blood and water.
<a class="verse" id="19v35"></a>And he who saw this has offered testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knows that he speaks the truth, so that you also may believe.
<a class="verse" id="19v36"></a>For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You shall not break a bone of him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="19v37"></a>And again, another Scripture says: <span class="quote">&ldquo;They shall look upon him, whom they have pierced.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="19v38"></a>Then, after these things, Joseph from Arimathea, (because he was a disciple of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, but a secret one for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate so that he might take away the body of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>. And Pilate gave permission. Therefore, he went and took away the body of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
<a class="verse" id="19v39"></a>Now Nicodemus also arrived, (who had gone to <span class="gold">Jesus</span> at first by night) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloe, weighing about seventy pounds.
<a class="verse" id="19v40"></a>Therefore, they took the body of <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, and they bound it with linen cloths and the aromatic spices, just as it is the manner of the Jews to bury.
<a class="verse" id="19v41"></a>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden there was a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
<a class="verse" id="19v42"></a>Therefore, because of the preparation day of the Jews, since the tomb was nearby, they placed <span class="gold">Jesus</span> there.

<a class="verse" id="20v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">Then on the first Sabbath, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb.
<a class="verse" id="20v2"></a>Therefore, she ran and went to Simon Peter, and to <span class="red">the other disciple, whom Jesus loved</span>, and she said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;They have taken the Lord away from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v3"></a>Therefore, Peter departed with the other disciple, and they went to the tomb.
<a class="verse" id="20v4"></a>Now they both ran together, but the other disciple ran more quickly, ahead of Peter, and so he arrived at the tomb first.
<a class="verse" id="20v5"></a>And when he bowed down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not yet enter.
<a class="verse" id="20v6"></a>Then Simon Peter arrived, following him, and he entered the tomb, and he saw the linen cloths lying there,
<a class="verse" id="20v7"></a>and the separate cloth which had been over his head, not placed with the linen cloths, but in a separate place, wrapped up by itself.
<a class="verse" id="20v8"></a>Then the other disciple, who had arrived first at the tomb, also entered. And he saw and believed.
<a class="verse" id="20v9"></a>For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that it was necessary for him to rise again from the dead.
<a class="verse" id="20v10"></a>Then the disciples went away again, each by himself.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="20v11"></a>But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bowed down and gazed into the tomb.
<a class="verse" id="20v12"></a>And she saw two Angels in white, sitting where the body of <span class="gold">Jesus</span> had been placed, one at the head, and one at the feet.
<a class="verse" id="20v13"></a>They said to her, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo;</span> She said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have placed him.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v14"></a>When she had said this, she turned around and saw <span class="gold">Jesus</span> standing there, but she did not know that it was <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
<a class="verse" id="20v15"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you seeking?&rdquo;</span> Considering that it was the gardener, she said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Sir, if you have moved him, tell me where you have placed him, and I will take him away.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v16"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;</span> And turning, she said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo;</span> (which means, Teacher).
<a class="verse" id="20v17"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to her: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do not touch me. For I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them: &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and to your Father, to my God and to your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v18"></a>Mary Magdalene went, announcing to the disciples, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I have seen the Lord, and these are the things that he said to me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="20v19"></a>Then, when it was late on the same day, on the first of the Sabbaths, and the doors were closed where the disciples were gathered, for fear of the Jews, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> came and stood in their midst, and he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Peace to you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v20"></a>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and side. And the disciples were gladdened when they saw the Lord.
<a class="verse" id="20v21"></a>Therefore, he said to them again: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v22"></a>When he had said this, he breathed on them. And he said to them: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.
<a class="verse" id="20v23"></a>Those whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and those whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="20v24"></a>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called the Twin, was not with them when <span class="gold">Jesus</span> arrived.
<a class="verse" id="20v25"></a>Therefore, the other disciples said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo;</span> But he said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Unless I will see in his hands the mark of the nails and place my finger into the place of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="20v26"></a>And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. <span class="gold">Jesus</span> arrived, though the doors had been closed, and he stood in their midst and said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Peace to you.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v27"></a>Next, he said to Thomas: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Look at my hands, and place your finger here; and bring your hand close, and place it at my side. And do not choose to be unbelieving, but faithful.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v28"></a>Thomas responded and said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;My Lord and my God.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="20v29"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;You have seen me, Thomas, so you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="20v30"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> also accomplished many other signs in the sight of his disciples. These have not been written in this book.
<a class="verse" id="20v31"></a>But these things have been written, so that you may believe that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, in believing, you may have life in his name.

<p class="normal dropA">
<a class="verse" id="21v1"></a></p><p class="normal firstline hidefirst">After this, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> manifested himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And he manifested himself in this way.
<a class="verse" id="21v2"></a>These were together: Simon Peter and Thomas, who is called the Twin, and Nathanael, who was from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
<a class="verse" id="21v3"></a>Simon Peter said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo;</span> They said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;And we are going with you.&rdquo;</span> And they went and climbed into the ship. And in that night, they caught nothing.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v4"></a>But when morning arrived, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> stood on the shore. Yet the disciples did not realize that it was <span class="gold">Jesus</span>.
<a class="verse" id="21v5"></a>Then <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Children, do you have any food?&rdquo;</span> They answered him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v6"></a>He said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the ship, and you will find some.&rdquo;</span> Therefore, they cast it out, and then they were not able to draw it in, because of the multitude of fish.
<a class="verse" id="21v7"></a>Therefore, the <span class="red">disciple whom Jesus loved</span> said to Peter, <span class="quote">&ldquo;It is the Lord.&rdquo;</span> Simon Peter, when he had heard that it was the Lord, wrapped his tunic around himself, (for he was naked) and he cast himself into the sea.
<a class="verse" id="21v8"></a>Then the other disciples arrived in a boat, (for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits) dragging the net with the fish.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v9"></a>Then, when they climbed down to the land they saw burning coals prepared, and fish already placed above them, and bread.
<a class="verse" id="21v10"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v11"></a>Simon Peter climbed up and drew in the net to land: full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
<a class="verse" id="21v12"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to them, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Approach and dine.&rdquo;</span> And not one of them sitting down to eat dared to ask him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span> For they knew that it was the Lord.
<a class="verse" id="21v13"></a>And <span class="gold">Jesus</span> approached, and he took bread, and he gave it to them, and similarly with the fish.
<a class="verse" id="21v14"></a>This was now the third time that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> was manifested to his disciples, after he had resurrected from the dead.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v15"></a>Then, when they had dined, <span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to Simon Peter, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?&rdquo;</span> He said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&rdquo;</span> He said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v16"></a>He said to him again: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rdquo;</span> He said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&rdquo;</span> He said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v17"></a>He said to him a third time, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rdquo;</span> Peter was very grieved that he had asked him a third time, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</span> And so he said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.&rdquo;</span> He said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Feed my sheep.
<a class="verse" id="21v18"></a>Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you are older, you will extend your hands, and another shall gird you and lead you where you do not want to go.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v19"></a>Now he said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had said this, he said to him, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v20"></a>Peter, turning around, saw the <span class="red">disciple whom Jesus loved</span> following, the one who also had leaned on his chest at supper and said, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, who is it who shall betray you?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v21"></a>Therefore, when Peter had seen him, he said to <span class="gold">Jesus</span>, <span class="quote">&ldquo;Lord, but what about this one?&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v22"></a><span class="gold">Jesus</span> said to him: <span class="quote">&ldquo;If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow me.&rdquo;</span>
<a class="verse" id="21v23"></a>Therefore, the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But <span class="gold">Jesus</span> did not say to him that he would not die, but only, <span class="quote">&ldquo;If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v24"></a>This is the same <span class="red">disciple who offers testimony</span> about these things, and who has written these things. And we know that his testimony is true.
</p>
<p class="normal"><a class="verse" id="21v25"></a>Now there are also many other things that <span class="gold">Jesus</span> did, which, if each of these were written down, the world itself, I suppose, would not be able to contain the books that would be written.
